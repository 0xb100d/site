**Grin is still highly experimental technology**

[Grin](https://github.com/ignopeverell/grin) is a blockchain and a
cryptocurrency focused on privacy and scalability. Grin is also an
implementation of the MimbleWimble transaction format with the extensions
required for a complete blockchain.

This site is geared toward developers or people who are willing to help grow a
technology that's still very early stage. If you're interested in the
cryptocurrency, how to use it or how to mine it, you will have to _wait until
it's ready_.

# Status

We're preparing to launch the first Grin testnet. We anticipate we will have
a few additional testnets afterward, followed by the launch of the fully
ready cryptocurrency.
