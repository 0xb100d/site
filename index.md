**Grin is still highly experimental technology**

Grin is a blockchain and a cryptocurrency focused on privacy and scalability.
Grin is also an implementation of the MimbleWimble transaction format with
the extensions required for a complete blockchain.

This site is geared toward developers or people who are willing to help grow a
technology that's still very early stage. If you're interested in the
cryptocurrency, how to use it or how to mine it, you will have to _wait until
it's ready_.

h1. Status

We're preparing to launch the first Grin testnet. We anticipate we will have
a few additional testnets afterward, followed by the launch of the fully
ready cryptocurrency.
