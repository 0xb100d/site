      <h2>What's Grin?</h2>
      <p>Electronic transactions for all. Without censorship or restrictions.</p>
      <p>Grin empowers anyone to transact or save modern money without the fear of external control or oppression. Grin is designed for the decades to come, not just tomorrow. Grin wants to be usable by everyone, regardless of borders, culture, skills or access.</p>

          <h3>Private</h3>
        </div>
        <p>Grin has no amounts and no addresses. Transactions can be trivially aggregated. To hide where a newly created transaction comes from, it gets relayed privately (a "random walk") among peers before it is publicly announced.</p>

          <h3>Scalable</h3>
        </div>
        <p>MimbleWimble leverages cryptography to allow most of the past transaction data to be removed. This guarantees Grin won't crumble under its own weight in the long term.</p>

          <h3>Open</h3>
        </div>
        <p>Grin is developed openly, by developers distributed all over the world. It's not controlled by any company, foundation or individual. The coin distribution is designed to be as fair (but not gratis) as is known to be possible.</p>
